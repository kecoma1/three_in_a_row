File where the board of the game is going to be defined.

    Added methods to see who won, this methods call other methods which
    check the rows, columns and also the diagonal of the game.
    The cost of the algorithms to check the rows, columns and horizontal is O(n)
    but the cost for checking the entire field before calling the these methods
    is O(nÂ²).
    Changed the style of the documentation

Date: 25/08/2020
    Minor change in method print_board
